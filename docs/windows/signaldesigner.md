The signal designer can be used to synthesise a signalling design
given an infrastructure containing tracks but no signals,
and given a set of auto-dispatch specifications (see [Dispatch](dispatch.md)).

The set of auto dispatches to be used as the basis for the 
synthesis are shown in the left part of the window, and can be
deactivated if you do not wish for the design to satisfy this auto 
dispatch plan. 

The right part of the window contains the designs that are output
from the synthesis procedure, along with their score. 
Select a design from the list to add it to the current infrastructure.
