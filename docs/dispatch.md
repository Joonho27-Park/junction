From the infrastructure view, you can start dispatching trains by either:

 1. Right-clicking a boundary node and starting a train from there. If no dispatch is 
    currectly selected in the dispatch selection menu, a new dispatch will be created.
 2. Opening the dispatch selection menu and adding a new dispatch.

The dispatch selection menu is used to open or close the dispatch view, to 
switch to another dispatch or to add, delete or rename dispatches.

## Dispatch selection

## Dispatch diagram view

When a dispatch has been opened in the dispatch selection menu, 
a diagram is shown at the bottom part of the window.
